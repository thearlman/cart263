        <p>As you know, dearest, I never use <span class="redacted">obscene phrases</span>  in speaking. You have never heard me, have you, utter an <span class="redacted">unfit word</span> <span class="secret">before</span> others. When men tell in my presence here filthy or lecherous stories I hardly smile. </p>

        <p>Darling, darling, tonight I have such <span class="secret">a</span> <span class="redacted"> wild lust</span> for your body that if you were here beside me and even if you told me with your own lips that half the <span class="secret">red-headed</span> louts of Galway had had a <span class="redacted">fuck at you</span>  before me I would still rush at you with <span class="redacted">desire</span> .</p>

        <p><span class="secret">God</span> Almighty, what kind of <span class="redacted">language</span>  is this <span class="secret">I</span> am writing to my proud blue-eyed queen! Will she refuse to <span class="secret">answer</span> my coarse insulting questions? I know I am risking a good deal in writing this way, but if she loves me really she will feel that I am mad with lust and that I must be told <span class="secret">all</span>.</p>

        <p>My darling <span class="redacted">Nora</span>, I am panting with eagerness to get your replies to these <span class="redacted">filthy letters of mine</span> . I write to you openly because I feel now that I can keep my word with you.</p>
        <p><span class="redacted">JIM</span></p>
