# Algorithmic bias is no laughing matter, so why is clickbait so funny?

The discussion around "data", and its implications on privacy and liberty is (to say the least) a trending topic. However, "data" is not a single faceted issue; rather, it is a go-to term used to describe and express the larger rats nest of social, infrastructural, and economic systems we find ourselves entangled in. While economies -and all of the forces which underpin them-  have never been simple to comprehend; with the advent of machine learning, and dare I say it -AI- as a method for calculating, predicting, and driving market forces, it would seem things have leveled-up some in their complexity. 

Not by coincidence, some of the largest companies in the world are now in the business of monetising, for lack of a better word, attention. And though advertising is not by any means a new business, nor entertainment, nor mixing the two; what is changing at an alarming rate is the fading ability to make out the lines between ad, content, and life. The platforms that we increasingly use to find work, transport, food, love, and to a larger and larger extent, fundamentally define ourselves, now have at their core "autonomous" systems if not deciding, at least influencing the who, what, where, when and why's of our lives.

Initially, [James Bridles essay](https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2) on the disconcerting world of algorithmically driven childrens YouTube content seems as comforting as it is frightening: being able to recognize algorithmic meddling assures us that we still have the upper hand. And while some of the videos are "disturbing", this is mostly because of the audience in question: innocent children, blissfully ignorant to the absurdity of the content, and the blatant manipulation so obviously at play. But as [BIll Brown has said:](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/riverbed_seashore/files/brown.pdf)

"We begin to confront the thingness of objects when they stop working for us: when the drill breaks, when the car stalls, when the windows get filthy, when their flow within the circuits of production and distribution, consumption and exhibition, has been arrested, how ever momentarily."

Just as we have come to rely on autonomous systems to entertain our children, we have come to rely on them to navigate our social, political, and geographical worlds. And though our experience of this new world is seemingly normal (when compared to video titles such as "Wrong Heads Disney Wrong Ears Wrong Legs Kids Learn Colors Finger Family 2017 Nursery Rhymes") it should not be mistaken for any [less algorithmically influenced.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal) 

So, if algorithmic influence is no laughing matter, why is clickbait so funny? Well, I for one, have a tendency to laugh when I'm uncomfortable. Algorithmically generated ads and headlines that miss their mark are merely a brief disruption in the seamless, largely invisible flow of data-driven content production and consumption that makes up the landscape of our inescapably connected world. Like passing by a demolished city street, and witnessing the tangled mess of naked gas lines and water pipes beneath squinting up at you in the daylight; the precarity of the taken-for-granted infrastructural equilibrium becomes visible, and reality shifts beneath our feet. These marvelously bizzare clickbait ads will undoubtedly become more and more endangered as digital "infrastructure" improves, and the algorithms on which they rely get better acquainted with us. But I for one think they are important: as they are a fading reminder of the system at play.
