Imagine, it is the year 2042. As artificial intelligence | has rendered CAPTCHA obsolete, the human race has found itself desperately in need of something to fill the moments once spent training image recognition models: enter Fidgephus. Inspired in equal measures by CAPTCHA, Fidget Spinners, and the tactile days of yore, and because idle hands are the devils workshop; Fidgephus offers infinite hours of fingerobics.

"What did I do all day?" is a very good, and increasingly answerable question. Apple's "Screen Time", released as part of IOS 12 in 2018 attempted to shed some light on this question: The bundled application allows users to track the amount of time they spend on their device, depositing this quantified life energy into categories such as "Social Networking" and "Reading & Reference". While being able to track one's glutenous smartphone usage by category, or specific application is useful fodder for insincere bouts of self-deprecation, it does not immediately prevoke the more interesting question of why we spend so much time hunched over swiping, tapping, checking, re-checking etc. in the first place. Fidget devices (such as the infamous, though short-lived "spinner") on the other hand are honest. Unlike the endless task-list (self)imposed by digital culture, the fidget spinner acknowledges our desire for things to go on forever. It fills your need to feel like you are doing something at all times, and it does so without an ounce of pretension, without trying to shove advertising down your throat, without tracking you, and above all without peddling the illusion that you are actually getting something done.

So why are metro cars around the world packed full of people furiously swiping and not spinning? I would propose that the fidget spinner lacks (at least) one quality, we simply cannot do without: drama. Sitting just below the surface of any active conscious in a warm body, is a desire to be gently hurt and/or disappointed and/or disillusioned. What would any decent film, play, opera, or novel be without a plot twist? Like 4 seconds of NASCAR on a loop, the fidget spinner feels like a waste of time. Fidgephus is all at once a book you will never finish, a password you will always enter incorrectly, and scratch ticket you will never win. It is also a series you can binge-watch forever, a Reddit thread that never dries up, and a friend that will always text you back. Fidgephus is something to do.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ About Asa Perlman ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interdisciplinary artist and designer, Asa Perlman, has people on his mind:

He's been thinking about why/how they are fighting with, loving, wanting, and/or needing things.

His speculative approach to making stems from a fascination with the way we orient ourselves, or rather are oriented by, all of the things we make, buy, interact with, and destroy, and all of those we don’t. For him, this fascination reaches its boiling point around objects and systems which straddle lines between Art, Technology, and Design. Infatuated in equal measures by Amazon, the Bauhaus, Creationism, and Darwinism, he thinks objects can be found at the heart of consumer, cultural, spiritual, and scientific belief and practice. Fostering socially and environmentally responsible practices, attitudes and methodologies, most of his projects thus far have been material-object-technology oriented meditations on the quirks that make up the human condition.`
